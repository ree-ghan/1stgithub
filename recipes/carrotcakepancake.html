    <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon pumpkin pie spice</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>

    <li>¾ cup finely grated carrot</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for griddle</li>

  <h1>steps</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Prepare the Pancakes: Whisk together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl until combined.

    </li>
    <li>Add buttermilk, brown sugar, egg, and vanilla; stir until just combined. Stir in carrots and melted butter until just combined. Set aside.

    </li>
    <li>Prepare the Frosting: In a medium bowl, whisk together cream cheese, milk, powdered sugar, and vanilla until smooth. Set aside</li>
    <li>Prepare the Topping: In a small bowl, stir together raisins, pecans, coconut, and ginger, if desired. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium. Grease skillet or griddle with butter.</li>
    <li>Working in batches, scoop 1/4 cup batter per pancake into the skillet, being sure not to overcrowd skillet. Cook until bubbles begin to form on surface of pancakes and edges look dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip, and cook until fluffy and slightly firm, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining batter, adding butter and adjusting heat as needed.</li>
    <li>Divide pancakes evenly among 4 plates. Drizzle Pancakes evenly with Frosting, and sprinkle evenly with Topping.</li>
